### 1 - Work / Project Examples
1. **BLOCKVILLE** (Independent Study Project)  
    - **Role:** Solo Project, I created and developed everything in the project.
    - I was inspired by Living Wine Labels as well as Pokemon Go. Augmented Reality technology fasinates me and after being inspired I really wanted to take a run at developing my own project. This is heavier in 3D modeling but I did touch on some AR/App development. To complete this project I used Maya for the 3D models; Unity for the development process, Vuforia as a plugin in Unity to help with the AR development; and Xcode to compress the app and put it out for testing.

2. **SEEDTRAKR** (Capstone Project)  
    - **Role:** I was responsible for designing 4/8 mock-up designs as well as develop the AngularJS model to showcase live on the web.
    - When my partner and I started this project we first met with the client top get further information and ideas on how their software worked and what they have done already. We had to recreate what they had, they wanted us to problem solve and figure out new ideas on how they can present their product to their clients. After several meetings I was able to produce 4 out of the 8 mock-ups while my partner created the other 4. After that stage I moved on to the role of developing the AngularJS example. Seedtrakr uses AngularJS in their code so I wanted to further my knowledge and challenge myself.

3. **COPS & SLOBBERS** (Team Project) 
    - **Role:** I took the lead developer role of the project
    - My interest in C# and wanting to develop interactive products for users lead me to take the lead developer role for this project. This was a class project that we were only given a month to complete. Our job was to brainstorm a video game concept as a team and then further develop it into a demo that could be played and tested users online. I along with one of my team partners was responsible for development research. I then later would implement our findings into our project.

### 2 - Inspiration
1. **LIVING WINE LABELS** 
    - I had a friend show me this app. The idea of how they were able to show an AR animation off of print inspired me to jump into AR development. I wanted to further expand my knowledge and skills in Unity, Vuforia, and Maya to bring my Blockville project to life.

2. **PARTICLES.JS** 
    - It started with me wanting inspiration on how to make my portfolio pop. While scrolling through different pieces on CodePen I came across this Particle.js example. It inspired me to implement a similar design within my own portfolio landing page.

### 3 - Focus
If I was given the opportunity to further develop my knowledge and skills in AR/VR and App/Web development I would take it and run with it. I would love to learn more on how to use C# and Javascript when developing experiences with AR and VR projects. I would also love to learn more on how to use php & Javascript when developing apps or websites. I have breifly investigated python as well, if I ever had the chance to learn more about it and AI I would take that opportunity in a heart beat.

### 4 - Code Challenge
1. My first step was to create an array out of the list that was provided. To do so I enclosed the list using square brackets followed by quoting each line and making sure they were seperated by a comma.
2. My second step was to render each line of the array to the DOM. I did this by adding <li> tags around the "song" array.
3. My third step was to display each array item to the page sequentially, at 1.5 second intervals. This was a challenge. I accomplished this by putting in a for loop in order to cycle through the individual lines within the array as well as setting up a setTimeout to implement the 1.5 second intervals into the challenge. 
4. Finally I added some CSS styling to the mix to bring together a nice and clean presentation.
