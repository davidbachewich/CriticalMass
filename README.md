### 1 - Work / Project Examples
1. **BLOCKVILLE** (Independent Study Project)  
    - **Role:** Solo Project, I created and developed everything in the project.
    - I was inspired by Living Wine Labels as well as Pokemon Go. Augmented Reality technology fasinates me and after being inspired I really wanted to take a run at developing my own project. This is heavier in 3D modeling but I did touch on some AR/App development.

2. **SEEDTRAKR** (Capstone Project)  
    - **Role:** I was responsible for designing 4/8 mock-up designs as well as develop the AngularJS model to showcase live on the web.

3. **COPS & SLOBBERS** (Team Project) 
    - **Role:** I took the lead developer role of the project
    - My interest in C# and wanting to develop interactive products for users lead me to take the lead developer role. This was a class project that we were only given a month to complete. Our job was to brainstorm a video game concept as a team and then further develop it into a demo that users could test out.

### 2 - Inspiration
1. **LIVING WINE LABELS** | **Link:** https://www.livingwinelabels.com/en-ca/19-crimes  
I had a friend show me this app. The idea of how they were able to show an AR animation off of print inspired me to jump into AR development. I wanted to further expand my knowledge and skills in Unity, Vuforia, and Maya to bring my Blockville project to life.
2. **PARTICLES.JS** | **Link:** https://codepen.io/koca/pen/eNJVKQ  
It started with me wanting inspiration on how to make my portfolio pop. While scrolling through different pieces on CodePen I came across this Particle.js example. It inspired me to implement a similar design within my own portfolio landing page.

### 3 - Focus
If I was given the opportunity to further develop my knowledge and skills in AR/VR and App/Web development I would take it and run with it. I would love to learn more on how to use C# and Javascript when developing experiences with AR and VR projects. I would also love to learn more on how to use php & Javascript when developing apps or websites. I have breifly investigated python as well, if I ever had the chance to learn more about it and AI I would take that opportunity in a heart beat.
